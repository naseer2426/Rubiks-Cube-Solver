# About the program:

  A program that can solve any Rubik's Cube using Fredrich CFOP Method.  
  The back-end was coded without using any APIs or brute force algorithms. The solution algorithm is composed of smaller algorithms each designed to solve a particular step of the Fredrich CFOP method.  
  The front end is coded using Tkinter. The solution is displayed using a 3D Rubik's cube, that was coded using 3D plane projection and affine transformation equations.

# How to run the program?

- #### If you have python installed:

      Clone the directory and run rubiks_cube_solver.py

-  #### If you don't have python installed (for windows users only):

        Clone the directory and run the rubiks_cube_solver.exe file.
